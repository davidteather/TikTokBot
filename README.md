# TikTok Video Bot

Consider sponoring me [here](https://github.com/sponsors/davidteather)

This project downloads the trending tiktok videos and compiles them into a video.


**NOTE** This project will most likely be behind my TikTok-API. Adapt that to use FFMpeg if you want a better experience [TikTok-API](https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api). I will still update this just it will most likely be a few updates behind that other repo.
